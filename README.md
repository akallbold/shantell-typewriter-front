# Shantell Typewriter

Shantell Martin is a brilliant artist who recently created a font based off of her handwriting, [Shantell Sans](https://shantellsans.com/). It's rad. I wanted to build an app that used it and came up with this.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i && npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
